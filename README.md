# Katalon-Platform-WebUITesting

Katalon Platform is a software quality management platform that enables you to conduct the entire software testing life cycle (STLC) and deliver high-quality software in every release. It offers different modules and solutions for each phase of the testing cycle, including test planning, authoring, organizing, executing, and analyzing.

Katalon and use different techniques and low-code solutions to create, organize, manage, execute automated tests in different environments, and manage reports in one single platform.

Katalon supports three methods to create automated tests: Record and Playback, using keywords in the Manual Mode, and scripting in the Script Mode.

Record and Playback is a great solution to start for beginners and non-programmers. But to improve the test quality as time goes on, they should learn how to use the built-in keywords in the Manual Mode and ultimately get down to scripting to have more control over the test design.

For test planning, the Platform (formerly Katalon TestOps) allows you to:

- plan builds and releases

- align tests with business requirements

- organize and manage tests

- schedule executions in cloud environments

- evaluate whether the application under test is ready to be released
